                            Welcome to my design portfolio! Here, I am showcasing the works that I have created 
                            as part of our Computation in Design module in Semester 2. This module has been a valuable learning 
                            experience <br>for me as it has allowed me to <b>explore the world of <font color="#DCFF6A" f>design communication</font> through the lens 
                                of code <br>and computation.</b>

                                This module provided many opportunities for us to freely experiment with various techniques, 
                                from generative design to data visualisation, and apply them to real-life scenarios. 
                                We also gained an in-depth understanding of how computation connects to the world of design.

                                Throughout the semester, I participated in four diverse workshops, including <b>Creative Coding, 
                                    Projection Mapping, Making, and Physical Computing.</b> These workshops taught us how to create 
                                    physical mediums with abstract patterns, expand our knowledge of showcasing videos using code, 
                                    combine digital tools and physical labor to create unique geometric shapes, and experiment with 
                                    simple input and output mechanisms utilizing electronics for tangible designs.

                                        Andreas Schlegel's Coding workshop explores the creative application of code in design. 
                                        The brief my partner and I chose was the Axidraw brief where we learned how to create a machine-drawn pattern
                                        generated by us.
                                        
                                        The workshop introduced us to digital techniques that can be applied creatively, expanding our 
                                        skill set beyond the traditional design toolkit. By selecting a brief aligned with our interests, 
                                        we explored the possibilities of creative coding in design and gained practical skills for future projects.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                        For the Coding workshop, we decided to challenge the notion of nature as beautiful and
                                        created visuals resembling worms and intestines using circular shapes in p5js. While the
                                        coding process was enjoyable, we faced difficulties working with the new Axidraw machine.
                                        Nevertheless, seeing the machine draw our code with such precision was fascinating.
                                        Overall, this workshop allowed us to experiment with unconventional design ideas and
                                        provided an opportunity to explore the capabilities of digital tools in bringing our ideas to life.

                                        In Dhiya's workshop, we explored the process of transforming code to objects, 
                                        known as <i>'Code to Thing'</i>. Through this workshop, we were introduced to a code template to generate 3D objects. 
                                        These 3D objects were then converted into templates using blender, which allowed us to apply add-ons to 
                                        physically create a 3D object. Additionally, we focused on documenting our work and generating 
                                        content for the 3D objects, resulting in an A3 folded printed artefact that could function as a 
                                        brochure or poster. Through these processes, we gained an understanding of working with both 
                                        digital and physical tools, as well as a workflow from digital to print.

                                        The process of creating a 3D object from code was both exciting and challenging. 
                                        As I experimented with different values, I realized how small changes could have a big 
                                        impact on the shape of the object. However, the most challenging part was cutting and gluing the 
                                        shape as it required lots of precision, which I struggled with. Dhiya taught us that using the sharp 
                                        corner of the penknife 
                                        blade to score the paper improves accuracy, which was so helpful. The process also made me aware of 
                                        the importance of meticulousness when gluing, as even small smudges can affect the final outcome.

                                            In Jo's Projection Mapping workshop, we explored the basics of projection mapping and developed 
                                            a concept for the prompt <i>"Other Worlds"</i> using p5js. Our project involved projecting static and 
                                            moving images onto physical shapes to create an immersive visual experience that reflects otherworldly 
                                            concepts. During the open studio, we carefully selected project elements that complemented each other, 
                                            allowing for a seamless integration of the visuals and physical objects. Overall, this workshop helped 
                                            us understand the potential of projection mapping as a tool to enhance visual communication and create 
                                            impactful designs.

                                            My partner and I focused on creating surreal/absurd concepts of 
                                            a fish swimming in unusual environments. We used a 3D hexagonal shape and a triangle 
                                            as our medium. While it was exciting to see our concept come to life, we faced several roadblocks. 
                                            The masking required lots of focus, and even a slight shift 
                                            in angle could throw off the entire projection. Looking back, we could have had a more experimental 
                                            approach and pushed the boundaries further. However, this experience was a valuable lesson in learning 
                                            how to balance creativity with practicality, and I look forward to applying these lessons in future projects.

                                                In this workshop, we explored the intersection of the physical and digital worlds through the 
                                                use of basic electronics and an Arduino microcontroller. Our main objective was to create an 
                                                interactive artifact that narrates a story that loosely revolves around the theme of sentient 
                                                shapes, using electronics and a controller. By interacting with the artifact, the 
                                                user can trigger abstract expressions on a digital screen or initiate physical feedback through 
                                                light or motion in the real world. Besides gaining knowledge of a new medium, this workshop also 
                                                encouraged us to communicate our ideas using non-traditional media, which allowed us to engage in 
                                                cross-disciplinary discussions and expand our skill set.

                                                We teamed up in duos and focused on physical to digital outputs. However, we were 
                                                unsatisfied with our initial idea and decided to pivot at the last minute. Our new concept aligned 
                                                better with the slightly abstract brief and involved coding a visual that mimicked disco lights. 
                                                The presence of light would cause the disco ball to spin more rapidly, while the absence of light 
                                                would result in a slower spin and more vibrant lights. Ultimately, this project encouraged us to be 
                                                open to experimentation, and we successfully incorporated both physical and digital 
                                                elements into our creation. It also highlighted the importance of relevance, 
                                                as our disco-themed artefact was best enjoyed in the darkness of night.

                                                        <br>
                                                        This semester has been a little bit of an eye-opener for me as it became more evident how Computation connects closely to
                                                        Design Communication. I also learned that computation is not just a tool for making flashy graphics or interactive websites; 
                                                        it's a mindset that can help you think more critically and creatively about the design process. By breaking down complex 
                                                        problems into smaller, more manageable chunks, you can explore different possibilities and experiment with new ideas that 
                                                        you might not have considered otherwise. Very cool..

                                                        My personal favourite would be discovering how the Axidraw can effortlessly bring even the most meticulous generative art to life.
                                                        It was extremely impressive to see how the Axidraw brought the most elaborate ideas to life with such accuracy and attention
                                                        to detail. It helped me realise how smoothly technology and creativity can coexist and the seemingly endless possibilities that 
                                                        result.

                                                        Before this module, I would say that my design approach was a bit narrow, which often resulted in limited ideas 
                                                        and solutions. However, through the various workshops and projects, I learned to think more abstractly and generate 
                                                        unique ideas that incorporated code. I discovered that computation can be a powerful tool to push the boundaries of 
                                                        design and unlock new possibilities. By embracing new techniques and experimenting with different mediums, I found 
                                                        myself able to break out of my comfort zone and create designs that were truly original and captivating.
